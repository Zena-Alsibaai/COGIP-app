## What's COGIP-APP ?

It's a challenge assigned by [BECODE](https://becode.org/) training center.

## The mission :

*** The COGIP is a company which we don't know an all lot about apart that they produce Jean-Michel toys and that they are serious workers. They also have a incredible team spirit within their rank.
